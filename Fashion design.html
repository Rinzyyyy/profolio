          The protagonist in the movie "The Artist" refuses to accept being
          replaced by the advance of color and sound in film. <br />
          He resists alone and says, "Only through rebellion can one be
          remembered." <br />
          Eventually, he finds a balance in his heart and embraces color,<br />
          Perhaps use protest to demonstrate the value of mime to himself, so
          that he can willingly let it go and move on.

          To shed the anxiety of appearance and the ugliness imposed by others'
          perceptions, is to revel in the body that is uniquely mine. By using
          unconventional materials and experimental techniques, turning the
          physical features that society deems repulsive or undesirable into
          works of fashion, which is people use to enhance their physical
          appearance.

          Like a superhero guarding their tribe, striving to preserve and carry
          on the precious traditions and culture. <br />
          I use cloth and spray paint to print the unique patterns of the Amis
          tribe. <br />The combination of plastic and PC board chips represents
          the integration of tradition and modernity, <br />aiming to continue
          the legacy rather than replace it.

          Inspired by reptiles, the design features layers upon layers of
          scales, repeating but never identical. <br />The fabric texture of the
          serpent's body is created through precise folds and stitching
          techniques. <br />The unique collar design and extra-long lapels are
          inspired by the teeth and tongue of reptiles.
